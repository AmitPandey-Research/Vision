# Vision

📘 Note: I'm gradually publishing a collection of past assignments and project work that I've worked on over time. Taking this as an opportunity to revisit, clean up, and share these learnings openly. More to come as I continue organizing and uploading!

🛠️ Pardon the mess! Many of these projects have been rescued from college cloud servers, old laptops, and forgotten Google Colab tabs. I'm still in the process of structuring the repositories, adding helpful notes, and making the code more user-friendly. Thanks for your patience — version 2.0 (a bit more polished) is on the way!


📂 Repository Structure
This repository is organized into folders that reflect the progression of topics and assignments. Here's a quick overview:

basics1/, basics2/, ...
Foundational concepts and notebooks covering core concepts — mostly early coursework or fundamental building blocks.

Other folders with descriptive names
These will include more specialized or project-based work (e.g., Advance Image Processing, Computer Vision, Research Demos, etc.), depending on the focus of the content.

As I continue cleaning up and uploading more work, this structure may evolve. I’ll aim to keep things logically grouped and well-labeled to make browsing easier.
