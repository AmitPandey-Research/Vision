# Vision

📘 Note: I'm gradually publishing a collection of past assignments and project work that I've worked on over time. Taking this as an opportunity to revisit, clean up, and share these learnings openly. More to come as I continue organizing and uploading!

🛠️ Pardon the mess! Many of these projects have been rescued from college cloud servers, old laptops, and forgotten Google Colab tabs. I'm still in the process of structuring the repositories, adding helpful notes, and making the code more user-friendly. Thanks for your patience — version 2.0 (a bit more polished) is on the way!
